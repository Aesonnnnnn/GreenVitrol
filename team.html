"Green Vitrol" might sound weird at first,but let me make you clear the concept of the project.The term 'Green' stands for safe and convenient,and the 'Vitrol' is basically bitter harsh or the truth. As there are 'Patient Matching' and 'Dcotor Search' in the user interface, it allows for the matching of a previous reports of patient 1 with patient 2 that have similar statistics report related to him/her. Then,Our web link the patient 1 to the doctor search interface via which the patient 1 can easily and convinently connect to the doctor of patient 2.So, it facilitates easy doctor appointments for common patients.The team aims to connect patients, doctors, and hospital professionals through advanced tools and technology. Furthermore, it enumerates a variety of diagnostic tests to provide new and updated data to the doctor currently treating the patient.The points mentioned below are the major objective of this project.</p>
        <p>1.Enhance Diagnostic Accuracy: Improve the accuracy of diagnostic techniques across healthcare facilities by integrating advanced data analytics and informatics tools, enabling faster and more reliable patient diagnoses.</p>
        <p>2.Optimize Patient Care: Utilize data-driven insights to optimize patient care, focusing on early detection, personalized treatment plans, and improved clinical decision-making, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</p>
        <p>3.Develop Innovative Solutions: Create innovative tools, platforms, or algorithms that harness the power of healthcare informatics to streamline operations, reduce errors, and increase efficiency in healthcare delivery.</p>
        <p>4.Global Health Data Collection and Analysis: Collect and analyze global health data to identify trends, patterns, and best practices, which can be used to address healthcare challenges and improve services worldwide.</p>
        <p>5.Access worldwide data : Any doctor or professional hospital staff can access the data of patients from its past to present if he wants in any corner of the world .</p>
